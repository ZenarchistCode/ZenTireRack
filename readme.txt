What Is This?

This mod adds a craftable tire rack to the game. Use 30 nails on 1 sheet metal to make a tire rack.

The tire rack stores 8 wheels (all vanilla wheels except for double truck wheels as they're massive), a tire iron, a tire repair kit and a gasoline canister.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

Make sure to merge the types.xml for "Zen_TireRack" into your server types and adjust the item's lifetime, or the racks will despawn on server restart and/or if no players are around.

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.

3D Model Credits:

The rack model was free on Sketchfab under the CC Attribution license. The only modification I made was to remove the included tire models and replace them with DayZ wheel proxies.

Repack & Source Code:
